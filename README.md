# AI Chatbot

In this project an intellgent chatbot was created to learn from users and answer questions about the hit BBC series Doctor Who. The chatbot used natural language processing and TF-IDF to match users inputs to relevant questions to provide an appropriate answer. Internally a first order logic system is integrated to allow the system to prove or disprove statements and statements it cannot disprove will be added to the knowledge base to further the AI's understanding of the program. Fuzzy logic was also used to provide rating of individual episodes from the show.

In addition to this a cognitive neural network was used to identify characters in images and Azure cognitive services was also used to describe images and recongise faces within those images. Finall text to speech was used so users with motor difficulties can interact with the chatbot through speech and the AI could then speak back to user so users who struggled to read could aslo use the sytem.
